Notes: This allows you to use Go Note Go away from a power outlet. You can also power Go Note Go directly from your car, laptop, or a standard outlet via USB if your use case allows Go Note Go to remain plugged in during use.

Cost: ~$14-19

### Velcro

Cost: ~$7

### USB Cables

Links:
* USB to USB-C cable for connecting the Pi to power sources
* Short cables may be useful for connecting peripherals while minimizing clutter

## Other Tools for Setup

These tools aren't Go Note Go specific, but may help you in the setup process:

### External Monitor (temporary, for initial setup)

This can be useful for initial debugging, but is not required with the new setup process.

### USB Mouse (temporary, for initial setup)

This can be helpful during initial configuration but is not required with the new setup process.
