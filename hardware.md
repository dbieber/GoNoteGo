## Hardware Guide

Here is some sample hardware you can use to build your own Go Note Go. Costs might exclude taxes and shipping.

### Raspberry Pi 400

## Additional Hardware: Take Go Note Go on the Go

The following parts are optional, but will better allow you to take Go Note Go on the go.

### 10000 mAh battery

Link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JYYRT7T

Notes: There are lots of options for the battery. This one works just fine. Could choose one with more storage for longer battery life if desired, but might get clunky. You also don't strictly _need_ a battery. You can also power Go Note Go directly from your car, laptop, or a standard outlet via USB. So if your use case allows Go Note Go to remain plugged in during use, you can forego the battery.

Cost: $19 (currently $14)

### Velcro

Link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08P3MXLLD

Notes: I use this Velcro to mount the keyboard to the passenger side of the car, and to mount the battery to the back of the keyboard. When applying the sticky side to a car dashboard, allow to dry overnight.

Cost: $7

### USB Cables

Links:
* 3 ft USB - USB C cable: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089DM4KDW
* 6 in USB - USB C cable: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012V56D2A

Cost: $13 ($6.99 for 3 ft and $5.99 for 6 in)

### The Beautiful Red Button

## Other tools

These tools aren't Go Note Go specific, but will help you in the setup process.

### External monitor and a USB Mouse.

These will be useful for configuring and debugging Go Note Go, e.g. setting up WiFi and configuring your note-taking system.

### Wire, Wire Stripper

If you use The Beautiful Red Button you'll need wire and wire strippers. For wire I used 18 gauge lamp wire I got from Home Depot.

Wire stripper link: https://www.amazon.com/Mr-Stripper-Stripping-Crimping-Electrical/dp/B086V5M1B4 (I chose this link arbitrarily; I got mine at Home Depot).

Notes: I don't know if this is the best choice for wire; a higher gauge might be better.

### Solder? Soldering iron?

I haven't had to use solder yet, but might need to for hooking up the button.

Hot glue or heat shrink and a heat gun might be nice-to-haves too to ensure solid stable connections.

### Possible other parts for button

These might be useful for connecting the button to the GPIO pins on the Pi:

I don't know. In my experience these were too loose to fit nicely on the GPIO pins.
