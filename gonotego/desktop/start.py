"""
Go Note Go app for Mac.

Puts GNG in the Mac toolbar so you can see if it's active.
Adds a keyboard shortcut for toggling recording on and off.
When active, keystrokes are logged and processed.
When inactive, nothing is recorded.

How does this work?
We store the active/inactive state in redis,
and show the latest value in the toolbar.
The text and audio recording processes use this status to determine whether to record
any notes.

TODOs:
- [x] Add keyboard shortcut for toggling active status.
- [x] Show active status in toolbar.
- [x] Respect active status in text.
- [x] Respect active status in audio.

- [x] On quit, spin down all processes.
- [] Restart subprocesses if they fail.
